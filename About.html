		<h1 class="title">About Self-Care</h2>
		<p class="body-text">Self-care as a concept is pretty simple, you do activites that help you to take care of yourself - whether it be physically, emotionally, or mentally. However, practicing self-care can be tricky for some, the idea of taking time out of our busy schedules to pamper ourselves might seem like a waste of time. Sometimes it is good to waste time. The wonderful thing about self-care is that it can take whatever form that suits you best, after all itâ€™s your time to be a little selfish.</p>
